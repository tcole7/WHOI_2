## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(index = 1:nrow(gapminder))
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "Vietnam")) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(max_gdp = max(gdp))
```

## `group_by()` groups!
```{r}
gap_groupled <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap,
         max_gdp = max(gdp)) %>%
  ungroup()
